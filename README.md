Here's a sample `README.md` you can use for your Java-based currency converter project (named **CurrX**) that works **without using an API**:

---

# 💱 CurrX - Offline Currency Converter (Java)

**CurrX** is a simple, offline Java-based currency converter that allows users to convert between multiple currencies using hardcoded exchange rates. It is designed for learning purposes or basic use where external APIs are not required or available.

---

## 📌 Features

- Convert between major currencies (e.g., USD, EUR, INR, GBP, JPY, etc.)
- No need for internet access or API keys
- Simple and beginner-friendly Java code
- Console-based interactive interface

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8 or above)
- No external libraries
- No API usage

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Exchange rates are **predefined** in the code. When a user selects the source and target currencies and enters an amount, the program uses these hardcoded rates to calculate the converted value.

Example snippet:
```java
double usdToInr = 83.12;
double inrToUsd = 1 / usdToInr;
```

## 🧩 How to Add More Currencies

To add a new currency:

Let me know if you'd like the actual Java code for `CurrX` too, or if you're planning to use a GUI version (like with Swing).
